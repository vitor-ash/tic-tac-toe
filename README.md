# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ played in the terminal. This little game is based on a [Neps Academy](https://neps.academy/br/dashboard) project with the same name ([Tic-Tac-Toe](https://neps.academy/project/22))

## Playing Tic-Tac-Toe
At the beginning, we have a 3x3 board, numbered from 1 to 9, like this:

Now it's time for the first player (X) to choose one of the nine positions (making sure to not pick an already marked one). <br />
