# Tic-Tac-Toe
---
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ played in the terminal. This little game was based on a [Neps Academy](https://neps.academy/br/dashboard) project with the same name ([Tic-Tac-Toe](https://neps.academy/project/22))
## Playing Tic-Tac-Toe

Initially, we have a 3x3 board, numbered from 1 to 9, as follows:

Now it's time for the first player (X) choose one of the nine positions (making sure to not choose an already marked one).
